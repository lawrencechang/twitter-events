Overall task


The overall task of this project is to accurately determine a Twitter user’s unstated meta characteristics as pertaining to the domain of professional North American sports. This includes characteristics like the user’s favorite team, most liked and most hated players, whether they are making factual statements about the game versus opinions versus sarcasm. Each feature is determined by a combination of methods. Methods employed include keyword lists, keyword frequencies, sentiment analysis, truth versus putative statement comparison.
